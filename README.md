#  Code Crypt: Assembly Endgame

A web-based word guessing game where you must protect the programming world from being overrun by Assembly! Inspired by Hangman, but with a developer twist. Built using **React**, this is the final project of Scrimbaâ€™s Frontend Developer Career Path.

##  Gameplay

You're given a mystery programming-related word.  
Each wrong guess eliminates a programming language.  
If all languages fall, you're left with nothing but... Assembly ðŸ˜±

-  8 guesses max  
-  Visual chips for each language  
-  Confetti celebration on win ðŸŽ‰  
-  Farewell messages on each wrong guess  
-  Final word reveal if you lose  
-  Fully accessible for screen readers  

---

##  Technologies Used

- **React**
- **React Confetti** (for win animations)
- **clsx** (for conditional classNames)
- **Custom state logic** for game status, keyboard interaction, and accessibility

##  What I Learned

This project helped reinforce key React concepts:

- Managing derived state (win/loss logic, incorrect guesses)
- Component-based architecture
- Conditional rendering and accessibility (ARIA roles, screen reader support)
- Using utility libraries like `clsx` for clean class handling
- Incorporating third-party packages (e.g., react-confetti)
